> Per Scholas - Week 10 - React - Assignment: React-Tac-Toe (with time travel!)

> This is my first `React` assignment through my Software Engineering course at Per Scholas. To play the game, a user clicks on squares to play tic-tac-toe. As the user plays, a history of moves is recorded, and the user can then "time travel" between moves. To implement the game functionality, I _mostly_ followed the tutorial in the [React Docs](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe).

**This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).**

## Available Scripts

### In the _<ins>project</ins>_ directory, you can run:

#### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Starts the backend on port 5000.\
Starts the frontend on port 3000.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### In the _<ins>client</ins>_ directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Future Work

- Improvements, listed in order of increasing difficulty:
  - For the current move only, show “You are at move #…” instead of a button.
  - Rewrite Board to use loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
  - Add a toggle button that lets the user sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
  - When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
  - If no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
  - Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
